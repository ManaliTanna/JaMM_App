## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT
 In the current era, gaming has become immensely popular, but very few platforms that unite and lets the gamers communicate and share with the world their gaming skills. There exist very few game networking mobile applications and none that provide a user friendly way to live stream. To tackle this issue, we have designed a unique gaming social networking app that allows its users to post insightful media, host as well as watch live streams and stay in touch with gamers all over the world through instant messagaing. This microblogging App uses flutter, an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.

### Write-up on the approach taken for UI design* (required)

This is a highly communicative platform, with creative features, posting and streaming options, which is not just limited to gamers of one community but all communities. Gamers can now make entertaining live streams and posts all with one touch on their mobile screens. We have made the theme and the color scheme of the app attractive to its users.The dark-mode with a striking blue and orange contast is pleasing to the eyes. It has an incredibly simple navigation and easy to read fonts and icons. With our unique app, not only does the popularity of the gamers increase but also the of the games they play. We are aiming to provide a wonderful user experience.
